****FCFS****
Average Waiting time: 37408.277344
Average Turn-around time: 10.486800
****SRTF****
Average Waiting time: 23139.687500
Average Turn-around time: 38260.093750

These values make sense because we expect Shortest Remaing time first (SRTF) to have a minimum average waiting time and so with a waiting time of 23139.69 < 37408.28, we see SRTF has a lower average waiting time. The SRTF turn-around times are expected to be longer than FCFS, and we also see this in the simulated algorithms.
